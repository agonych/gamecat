# Decision Tree Guessing Game

## Overview
This project implements a simple yet interactive game where a computer program tries to guess objects thought of by the user through a series of yes/no questions. Utilizing a decision tree, the game learns from each interaction, expanding its knowledge base with every new object introduced by the user.

## Features
- **Iterative Learning**: With each playthrough, the game's decision tree grows, becoming smarter and more capable of guessing a wider range of objects.
- **User Input Variation Handling**: Accepts variations of yes (y, yes, yep) and no (n, no, nope, none) answers to improve user experience.
- **Simple Text Interface**: Easy-to-navigate textual interface for straightforward play and learning.

## How to Play
1. Think of an object.
2. The game will begin by asking a series of yes/no questions to narrow down what the object might be.
3. If the game guesses wrong, it will ask you what the object was and request a distinguishing question to differentiate this new object from others.
4. The game learns this new information for future guesses.
